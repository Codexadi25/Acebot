# Acebot Alpha Test Version 0.0.1

### ü§ñ acebot ‚ú®

-----

**Acebot** is a powerful productivity tool that lets you create custom text shortcuts to streamline your daily tasks. It's built with Python and acts as a keylogger to detect specific keywords you type and instantly replace them with longer, predefined messages. This is a great way to save time and reduce repetitive typing for employees, students, or anyone who frequently uses the same phrases or information. üöÄ

#### How It Works üß†

The program runs in the background, listening for your keyboard input. When it detects a specific trigger word you've set (like "hi" or "btw"), it automatically deletes that word and inserts the full text you've assigned to it.

For example:

  * Typing **"hi"** can instantly expand to **"Hi, this is CodexAdi."** üëã
  * Typing **"btw"** can instantly expand to **"between"**
  * Typing **"enquery"** can expand to a full, multi-line inquiry response. üìù

#### Getting Started üíª

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codexadi25/acebot.git
    cd acebot
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    The program uses the `keyboard` library to monitor key presses. You can install it using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install keyboard
    ```

3.  **Run the program:**

    ```bash
    python acebot.py
    ```

#### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You can easily customize the shortcuts and their corresponding text by editing the `acebot.py` file. The shortcuts are defined in a dictionary, making them simple to add, remove, or modify.

The provided examples are a great starting point, but you can tailor them to fit your specific needs.

#### Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This tool uses a keylogger to function. It is designed to be a personal productivity aid and should only be used on your own computer. Use of this program on a computer you do not own or without the owner's explicit permission may be illegal. Be mindful of the security implications and ensure you are using it responsibly.

### Features ‚ú®

  * **Custom Shortcuts:** Create as many shortcuts as you need for any text.
  * **Time-Saving:** Automate repetitive typing tasks to boost your efficiency. ‚è≥

### Future Development: AI Integration üí°

I want to further build this tool to a greater extent by integrating AI to generate contextual text to make for a smoother workflow. Future updates may include features that leverage natural language processing to predict and suggest text expansions dynamically, going beyond simple predefined shortcuts to offer more intelligent assistance. This will allow the tool to adapt to your typing style and provide highly relevant text completions, making your day-to-day tasks even more seamless.
